      description:`Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, the film tells the story of prison warden Paul from the E Block of Cold Mountain. In this unit, criminals await their death penalty and walk down a corridor painted green for their final journey, hence the title of the piece. A new inmate is brought to the prison--an African American with the muscles of Goliath, the strength of an elephant, and the mind of a child--John Coffey. He is accused of raping and murdering two little girls. The case is closed, the punishment imminent, but the weeping death row inmate shows such overpowering kindness and sincere love for every earthly creature that he makes the warden seriously question his guilt and begin to investigate the case himself.`

      description:`The film is divided into six parts, which follow each other in no chronological order and show, in general, three stories. The first is about gangsters Jules and Vincent. Vincent takes a cocaine-addicted mobster's wife to a dance, and Jules escapes bullets and discovers a divine sign. The second is about a boxer, Butch, who breaks an agreement with the same mobster and gets into trouble over his father's gold watch. The third is about two burglars who get in the way of the bandits from the first story. All of these events, though related in meaning, are still more related in form. After all, it doesn't matter what the trigger was pulled for if it results in someone's brains being sprayed all over the interior of a car or the demise of someone who came out of the toilet at an unnecessary moment. It especially doesn't matter if it's funny, aesthetic, and Tarantino-esque`

      description:`Forrest Gump is a boy with an IQ of 75, which according to the modern American classification is characteristic of people with borderline mental retardation. But despite this, the main character's future is not as dramatic as it might seem. Through his perseverance and daily training, Forrest gains the ability to run fast (first to run away from bullies and then to get an athletic scholarship to attend college). Fate takes him to the war and the bleachers of the rally, table tennis, and the shrimping business. All in all, the two-and-a-half hour film tells the audience a life-affirming tale with a truly therapeutic effect and a return of the will to live.`

      description:`When freedom-loving literature teacher John Keating arrives at conservative Wellton College with an unconventional approach to teaching, he immediately has his admirers (students) and haters (other teachers). He opposes the traditional method of "cutting all students into one row" with his vision of education, namely, the education of an independent and harmonious personality. Instead of reading from memory, Keating recites from memory, encourages students to argue among themselves (on the topic, of course), discusses the transience of life, and frames literature not as a collection of tropes and artistic devices but as an outburst of feeling and emotion. But inadvertently stuttering about the "Society of Dead Poets" and giving the son of a failed military man advice to follow his dream, the teacher does not anticipate the consequences.`

      description:`The last breakthrough of the countercultural era of the 20th century, a spit in the direction of conformism, capitalism and consumer society, which for a short time pulls the viewer out of his comfort zone, shakes him well and offers to live on with this feeling of unfinished and wrongness of life - this is what this film is all about. The picture is based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. The main character is a man with no name, a gray mass with insomnia and an uncontrollable desire to collect pennies to buy furniture from IKEA. He is in his late 30s and goes to cancer groups to assert himself at the expense of other people's suffering. But one day Tyler Durden, a soap salesman, anarchist and non-conformist, bursts into his life. Together they create a "fight club," a place to vent their aggression. And then they come up with and implement the "Rumble" project to "clean up the world".`

But suddenly, the carefree, slightly gruff and perpetually smiling Driss arouses the man's interest. The guy is the only one who doesn't treat Phillip like a child, constantly forgets about his disability and jokes about seemingly forbidden topics. Driss brings back Philip's love of life. He convinces him to move from his "safe car" to a stylish sports car, to meet his pen pal, and to go for an ear massage. And Philip, in turn, helps Driss step away from his criminal dealings and sell a painting painted in the style of conceptual art.`
